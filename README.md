## Recursive Models of Dynamic Linear Economies (Hansen & Sargent)
### Chapter 15. Equilibrium with Distortions

Programs that will be implemented:
* disthet.m - solves competitive equilibrium of a distorted heterogeneous economy
* compare.m - translates solutions of non-distorted homogeneous economy from disthet.m
to a form comparable to the solutions produced by solvea.m (solves social plannerâ€™s
problem for economy from Chapter 4)
* double2.m - uses the doubling algorith to solve Riccati matrix difference equations
associated with the Kalman filter (utilize duality of recursive filtering problems and
linear optimal control problems)
* dimpulse.m - calculates impulse response functions (response of current and future
state to random shock)
